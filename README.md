# Random_Generator_Python_Project
## Description
The project aims to provide streamlined visualization, annotation, and statistical insights for DNA and its translated amino acid sequences.
To achieve the goal the following partss will be implemented:
* Data Sources: Use REBASE and NCBI datasets.
* Input: Accept DNA sequences (text/file), auto/manual annotate, translate to AA, and import from NCBI.
* Statistics: pI, AA composition, GC content, primer annealing temp, and user/platform trends.
* Visualization: Linear/plasmid maps and primer binding sites.
  
## Functionalities
### Data Sources
The data will be sourced from open datasets:
* REBASE
* NCBI (Human Refference Genome)

### Input Data
* The system must be able to read input text data/ data from a text file containing DNA sequence of interest either as a 5’- or 3’-strand and as a plasmid or as linear DNA
* The system can automatically annotate widely-known consensus sequences/restriction sites/reporter genes/purification tags/
* The system allows manual annotations of genes/sequences
* The system can translate the DNA sequence to encoded amino acid (AA) sequence
* The system provides possibility to import data from data banks (NCBI)

### Data Storage and Handling


### Statistical analysis
* Statistics concerning the DNA/AA sequence:
  * The amino acid sequence has statistics about pI of the protein, aa composition in %, molecular weight, …
  * GC content in DNA
* Primer design 
  * Annealing temperature

* Statistics concerning the platform:
  * Popular DNA sequences (most uploaded or referenced) 
  * Demographic data of people (customers/patients/…)
  * Statistics of user number per day/hour

### Visualization
* The system can visualize the sequence as a linear  or a plasmid map.
  
* Visualization for binding of primer on DNA
